## Module Name     --  swarmmode.tcl
## Original Author --  Emmanuel Fr√©con - emmanuel.frecon@ri.se
## Description:
##
##  This module focuses on the new Swarm Mode available as part of the Docker
##  Engine. The main procedure is called 'join': given a set of (declared
##  masters/managers) it will arrange for a node to join the Swarm cluster,
##  which inclused initialisation of the Swarm.
